# C# XML Documentation Comments Schema

## Introduction

This schema defines how XML comments should organized according to the program
structure of the language C#. This is not a actual specification nor a actual
standard, this for people who want to have a neat way to organize XML tags.

In practice it should work and has worked. In reality does not work well in after
a cleanup of the project or solution.
